                This project was initially to test my own skills using Photoshop, as it was a great way for me to
                practice these skills. Familiaried myself more with layout structuring, and knowing where and how
                material visually works in terms of hierachy communication. Then I tried filtering the images,
                manipulate and change the backgrounds to imploy a different setting and vibe from the original
                images.
                <br>
                <br>
                Plus, it's super fun to see my friends' reactions when they see themselves on a Vogue cover! I have then
                even started doing these as Christmas presents. it's also a great addition to my digital design
                portfolio. It's a perfect example of blending creativity with technical skills. I honestly really like
                it.
