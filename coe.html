            <h1>Council of Europe - Malta Organisation 2025 </h1> <br>
            <h2>Student Project</h2>

            <p>In 2024, the European Council Representative of Malta announced to MCAST that Malta would hold the
                Presidency of
                the Council of Europe from May to November 2025. As part of this initiative, students at MCAST Mosta
                were
                invited to develop a brand identity, with the best visual concept being selected for official use.
                Although the
                project had a tight deadline of only two months, the experience proved to be incredibly rewarding. While
                I did
                not win the final selection, my work was recognised and shortlisted among the top submissions.
                <br>
                <br>
                The logo is a symbolic composition featuring a stylized Maltese cross, conveying a message relevant to
                today's
                generation. Traditionally a symbol of protection, the cross is presented in a folded form, representing
                unity
                and the shared direction of the Maltese people. A sandy yellow line signifies the island itself and its
                renowned
                beaches, while additional elements introduce key national colours like red (from the Maltese flag) and
                blue that
                represents the sea. Together, these elements reflect both the cultural identity and natural beauty of
                Malta.
