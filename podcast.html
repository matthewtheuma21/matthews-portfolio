            <h1>GĦANDI BAGANDI ! - Very first <br> Podcast Idea</h1>

            <p>Presenting the very first idea that I had for a podcast. I always had a dream of creating a podcast on
                Spotfiy, discussing opinions and thoughts about various subjects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here's a little backstory...
                <br>
                <br>
                The idea originated from a humorous moment shared with my best friend. We often joke and
                act silly together, and during one of our conversations in Maltese, she meant to say "Għandi basket roża
                mal-libsa" (meaning "I have a pink basket with my dress")—but instead, she accidentally blurted out
                "Għandi Bagandi!". We burst into laughter and couldn’t stop repeating it. The phrase became so iconic
                between us that I immediately thought it would make the perfect, quirky name for the podcast I had
                envisioned.
                <br>
                <br>
                For context, "Għandi" means "I have" in Maltese. I built on this concept by structuring each podcast
                episode around a phrase starting with "Għandi", hinting at the episode’s theme or topic. I began working
                on visual branding for the podcast—designing Instagram posts, a profile icon, and creating a grungy,
                youthful aesthetic that suits the target audience I had in mind.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although the podcast hasn’t launched yet, I’m still in search of the right partner to collaborate with.
                Ideally, it would have been my schoolmate - the girl featured beside me on the podcast cover. However,
                due to her busy schedule she couldn’t commit. So for now, it is just an idea, with a visual presentation.
