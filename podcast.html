            <h1>GĦANDI BAGANDI ! - Very first <br> Podcast Idea</h1>

            <p>Presenting the very first idea that I had for a podcast. I always had a dream of creating a podcast on
                spotfiy, discussing opinions and thoughts about various subjects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here's a little backstory...
                <br>
                <br>
                The whole story started along with my schoolmate bestfriend, wwe always laugh and act silly with each
                other. And while she's talking to me on an occasion she had (in Maltese), she was suppose to say
                ("Għandi basket roża mal-libsa")... however it turns out that she actually mixed the words and said
                "Għandi Bagandi!".. and we couldn't stop laughing. It then turned out so iconic that I thought it would
                be an iconic name itself for the podcast I always dreamt of doing.
                <br>
                <br>
                To translate what 'Għandi' means for English readers, it means 'I have' in Maltese. So, I was thinking
                of having each episode, starting with 'Għandi' to refer to what the episode will be about. So I went on
                with creating visuals for Instagram posts and their profile pictures, and see what comes out. I thought
                of creating a young grunge vibe, as it fits the audience according to who I really recommend the podcast
                for.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unfortunatly, the podcast has not started streaming yet, as I still am looking for a partner to help. It
                would have made sense if I had my schoolmate bestfriend as my podcast partner, as she is the girl on the
                podcast cover next to me, however she was too busy and stressed the last time I asked. Maybe next year!
