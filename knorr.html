            <h1>Revamp of the Knorr Package</h1>

            <p>As part of a school assignment, we were asked to identify a product from everyday life whose packaging
                could benefit from a redesign. I chose the Knorr packaging, as I believe its current design feels
                outdated when compared to contemporary design trends. A refreshed visual identity could enhance its
                appeal, particularly among younger consumers, while maintaining the brand’s recognizability and
                heritage. In addition, I believe the conventional approach of featuring a straightforward image of the
                food accompanied by basic text has become repetitive and uninspired in packaging design. This
                stereotypical style often lacks creativity and emotional engagement. I think it's time to challenge this
                norm by introducing more playful, abstract, or conceptual visuals that can evoke curiosity and stand out
                on the shelf. Such approaches can make the product more visually striking and reflective of modern
                design sensibilities.

                I explored several concepts for this redesign, but the idea that resonated with me the most was rooted
                in a very organic and sensory-driven approach. I asked myself: why not visually represent the product
                using the product itself? No need of imagery. My concept was to cover the packaging in a grid-like pattern of chicken
                cubes—stylized to resemble the actual product. To make this visually engaging and dynamic, I varied the
                tones slightly between the cubes, using warmer and cooler shades of brown to create subtle contrast and
                texture.

                <br>
                As to one Knorr customer, I believe that the visual association with the product can evoke a sense of taste.
                The familiar colors and appearance of the chicken cubes can trigger a sensory connection, reinforcing
                the idea that packaging should not only be seen but also felt sensorially. In this case,
                it's about connecting sight with taste, creating a visual flavor experience.F
