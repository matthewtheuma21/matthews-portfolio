    <p>For a school project, I was tasked with creating a zine inspired by a poem—either an existing one or an original
        piece—with the aim of visually narrating a story. I chose to write my own poem, centered around a snail that
        innocently goes about its life, crawling across a mail envelope. However, its quiet journey takes a dark turn
        when a postman, disturbed by the snail’s mucus trail, violently removes it, ultimately resulting in the snail's
        death.
        <br>
        <br>
        The message behind this story is intentionally simple yet impactful. I wanted to highlight the cruelty that
        often goes unnoticed in everyday actions—particularly how some people react to snails. Unfortunately, it's not
        uncommon for people to smash or forcefully throw snails simply because they’re seen as inconvenient or
        unpleasant to touch.
        <br>
        <br>
        In structuring the poem, I began by setting a calm and relatable scene that reflects the snail’s natural
        behavior—its slow pace, its curiosity, and its harmless presence. The sudden shift into violence serves to
        provoke thought and emotion, emphasizing how small creatures can be victims of careless actions. Through this
        narrative, I aimed to raise awareness of our role in the ecosystem and to encourage a more compassionate
        perspective, even toward the smallest of beings.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A snail arrived by mail today,<br>
            Just how the snail got there,<br>
            I really can’t say.<br>
            But he’s a real smart one,<br>
            I hope he’ll stay.<br>
            <br>
            I see the postman coming again,<br>
            As he grabs the envelope to re-check the stain.<br>
            <br>
            Crickey! The snail is covering the address.
            <br>
            He waves the envelope up and down…<br>
            But the snail stays!<br>
            Sir Muller throws the envelope on the floor and lifts his knee up like a roar!<br>
            <br>
            Should not have followed anymore… </b><br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        This act of cruelty is not only unnecessary but also environmentally harmful. Killing a snail disrupts the
        natural processes it contributes to within the ecosystem. Furthermore, it reflects a broader disregard for
        living organisms and the essential roles they play—no matter how small or seemingly insignificant they may
        appear.
        <br>
        <br>
        Rather than resorting to harm, we can choose compassion. The next time one encounters a snail in an inconvenient
        place, it is worth pausing to recognise its value in the natural world. Gently relocating it to a safer, more
        suitable environment allows it to continue fulfilling its ecological role. Such a simple gesture of kindness can
        have a meaningful impact—not only on the individual creature but also on the wider balance of nature.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ultimately, every living being holds a purpose within the intricate web of life. By choosing to protect and
        respect even the smallest of creatures, we help foster a healthier ecosystem and promote a more humane,
        conscious way of living.
