                <P>Currently a student in MCAST Mosta, taking Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design Lvl 5. I am really into
                    photography, creating art on such digital softwares and making forms of advertisment.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I always have been dedicated to designing my work with an organised and vibrant layout, can be from my
                    school notes to anything that we as graphic designers create. As I grew up, I figured out that I am really
                    into the power of simplicity, and how it can display order and clean visuals. Simple use of two colours and
                    an eye-catching layout.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Maybe my least favourite medium would be working on animation, as its not really my go-to to work with,
                    because I am more into creating posters, brouchers, designing layouts for websites, video editing,
                    magazines, etcâ€¦
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, I have been given an opportunity to explore and dive deeper in the world of video editing and
                    help one of my family members in this industry he's in. We are using Adobe Premiere Pro, and it has been
                    nothing but fun working on. I have been creating interesting visuals and nice effects to these videos to
                    make them more engaging. None the less, I hope that this would be one of my biggest strenghts, as at school
                    we are not really focusing on video editing, but more on concept thinking, knowing what should be
                    considerate and not in graphic design and exploring different mediums in graphic design itself.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside the industry Graphic Design, I also have a passion of travelling in different countries to explore
                    the beauty of this world, testing myself on new stuff that I have never tried and teach myself valuable
                    lessons and always finding my own ways to achieve such goals in life.
