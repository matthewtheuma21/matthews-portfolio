            <P> I am currently a student at MCAST Mosta, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Graphic Design (Level 5). I have
                a strong passion for photography, digital art, and the creation of various forms of advertising.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have always been committed to designing my work with a structured and vibrant layout, or something
                bold and cool - whether it has
                to be the notes I take for class and even to my current projects. Over time, I discovered my deep
                appreciation for the power of
                simplicity
                in design. I am particularly drawn to the clarity and sense of order that minimalism can convey, often
                achieved through the use of just two colours and a striking, well-composed layout.
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside the field of Graphic Design, I enjoy challenging myself by trying
                new experiences, learning valuable life lessons, and continuously finding my own paths to achieve
                personal goals. I also have a strong passion for travelling to different countries,
                as it allows me to explore the beauty and diversity of the world. I been to many countries around
                Europe, and even North & South America and I hope to see the whole world.
                <br>
