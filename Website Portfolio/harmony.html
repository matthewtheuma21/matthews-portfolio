            <h1>The Ficticious Harmony Festival - Advertisment</h1>

            <p>This was another school assignment, and the given brief was to create visual posters for a music, culture
                and art festival that will be taking place in MFCC, Ta' Qali Park. For this project, I had multiple
                ideas were I can create on vector softwares or even raster softwares for the quality of the idea I had.
                Here below are the five ideas I had, were I implemented them digitally to see how they would look
                finalised. However, the main aim was to make it feel for its right audience, which was families visiting
                this festival. Some of the ideas I had focused more on just music (were I used a hip-hop dancer), some
                just on culture (were I used a man giving a speech on stage).. so I was sort of stuck in which to
                choose. I prefered that the poster would show all of the festical's aspects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Then I realised that the only generic idea I had was the last one, were I masked an image of a crowd
                into the text 'Harmony' spreaded across the A4 space. However I didn't really like it due to it looking
                like modern-grunge. I did like the colours, (Im a big fan of black, white and red) but its not just
                really speaking for the festival. So I thought of colour mapping it, changing the colours and see what
                would work.
                <br>
                <br>
                and BAM! This was the moment were I realised that this was the one. I really liked the blue tones on
                this poster, it made it look very friendly. Here and there, I wanted to arrange its layout and typefaces
                to keep it simple, yet effective.
