            <h1>T-Shirt Design - "its not professional and it's not ethical"</h1>

            <p>The brief was to create a t-shirt design for a fashion company called "cringecore", which bring bold and
                playful exploration of the "cringe" aesthetic, embracing humor, irony, and a touch of nostalgia. So I
                thought of these two famous Tiktokers from the US, who impersonate the Kardashians and recreate scenes
                from 'The Kardashians' TV Series. They refer to using quotes like "its not professional, and its not
                ethical", "Nnyyeeaaahhh" or even a "your dramatic and pathetic, gurl bye!"... which is very sassy but
                funny. I thought it works well with the brief, so I took on this decision to build up with and create
                designs.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here below are some of the other ideas I had, which I haven't use as the final idea. I wanted to explore
                different styles and visual interpretations to show the idea, to make it look appealing as a t-shirt.
                However, I wanted to keep up with a more constructed visual research, so I thought of sticking to a more
                modern-grunge look to it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Using photo manipulation, adding saturated colour and more treatment on texture, it helped everything to
                blend in. With the help of visual research, I looked at text treatment, and noticed the idea of
                dynamisim, using angles and serif-fonts. The final result came to this, here on the right. I am really
                happy with the final design, and been thinking to actually print the design on a t-shirt in the future
                soon.
