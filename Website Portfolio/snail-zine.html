    <p>for a school project, i had to create a zine taken from a poem or one written by myself, with the scope of
        showing a narrative visual. i chose to create a narrative myself, a poem about a snail that appeared to be doing
        its thing on a mail envelope, and gets killed by the postman who tries to remove its sticky mucus.
        <br>
        <br>
        the message behind the story is very simple, i wanted to find a way of unexpectedly showing how killing snails
        just for their roles is an act of cruelty to the ecosystem. some people do unfortunatly, smash or throw snails
        at a large force just because they either do not want to touch the snail or because it’s stuck on something. so
        the way i structured the story of the poem, was to first explain a setting about a normal life of a snail, that
        is stuck on a letter sticking outside the mailbox, until it unexpectedly takes a dark turn.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>A snail arrived by mail today,<br>
        Just how the snail got there,<br>
        I really can’t say.<br>
        But he’s a real smart one,<br>
        I hope he’ll stay.<br>
        <br>
        I see the postman coming again,<br>
        As he grabs the envelope to re-check the stain.<br>
        <br>
        Crickey! The snail is covering the address.
        <br>
        He waves the envelope up and down…<br>
        But the snail stays!<br>
        Sir Muller throws the envelope on the floor and lifts his knee up like a roar!<br>
        <br>
        Should not have followed anymore… </b><br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        this act of cruelty is not only unnecessary but also harmful. killing a snail disrupts the natural cycle it
        supports. moreover, it reflects a lack of respect for living creatures and the vital roles they play, no matter
        how small they may be.
        <br>
        <br>
        instead of resorting to harm, we can choose kindness. the next time you see a snail stuck somewhere, take a
        moment to appreciate its place in the world. gently move it to a more suitable location where it can continue
        its important work. this small act of compassion can have a significant impact, both on the individual snail and
        on the broader environment. let us remember that every creature has a role in the intricate web of life. by
        choosing to protect and respect snails, we contribute to a healthier, more balanced ecosystem and set an example
        of humane behavior.
