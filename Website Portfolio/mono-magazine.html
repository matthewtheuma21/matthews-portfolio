    <p>Presenting here, one of my most most favourite works I have done so far, as I have put so much
        dedication
        and
        time to it. It was only a school assignment, however I have planned photoshoots with a number of
        models
        that I
        know, been to places, planned everything according to all the themes and finding specific locations
        for
        each
        shoot (only the images of the celebrities are not taken by me). It was all a serious project. I took every step
        seriously, considering it works well for the
        project.
        <br>
        <br>
        I wanted to create a magazine, different than the usual, were one can find music categorised in
        different moods
        of music, from happiness, dark, love and even classic musics. But I wanted each genre to be filtered
        in
        their
        categorised colour, a colour that visually represents the mood on its own; so that each theme, each
        genre has
        its own style visually. Meanwhile showcasing top 20 different songs from that mood, the magazine
        also
        has
        articles about some artists coming from the perspected theme. The whole idea process was to look at
        other
        magazines like the 'Vogue', 'billboard', 'the rolling stones' magazines and other more, and see how
        they
        interpret information and make it look interesting. I also noticed that many magazines, have a
        follow up
        of
        different advertisements from different brands to promote their collections or new merchandise.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main idea was for me to promote music differently, not just looking at one artist's work or
        seeing
        the
        generic top 10 global music charts, like the 'billboard' company does. So the whole idea of diving
        the
        music
        into the themes was for people to explore what they like in a simple manner, where viewers can
        easily
        create
        their own playlist with the given songs mentioned, or even get to know more cool songs they will
        like
        that they
        have never heard of or simply never knew the name of the songs.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you would like to see the whole magazine, please do contact me (as I have the physical version
        printed). Its
        a 36 page magazine, full of articles, amazing songs to listen and a personal document about myself.
