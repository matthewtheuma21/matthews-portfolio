                <p>We have all loved watching the World Cup 2022, and well celebrated the victory of Argentina,
                    which was all held in Qatar. However we all saw the bright side, not the horrible harsh scenarios
                    that were happening during the construction of these stadiums. We all can agree that buildings are
                    very challenging and complex, although many reports have unleashed by their own workers and slaves.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most workers were <mark>from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and a few more</mark>, all facing
                    harsh and poor
                    conditions in their stay. They worked under tremendous heat, falling from heights due to poor
                    working
                    conditions, broken promises about payments, their rooms given were really bad, and more to mention.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Imagining the situation of these forced workers, being paid very low made me feel quite
                    uncomfortable. I
                    wanted to memorate these workers who have died, and show the world what lies under the world cup
                    that was
                    held
                    in 2022.
