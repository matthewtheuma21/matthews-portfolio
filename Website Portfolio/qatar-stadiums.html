        <h1>The Qatar Stadiums</h1>
        <p>We have all loved watching the World Cup 2022, and well celebrated the victory of Argentina,
            which was all held in Qatar. However we all saw the bright side, not the horrible harsh scenarios
            that were happening during the construction of these stadiums. We all can agree that buildings are
            very challenging and complex, although many reports have unleashed by their own workers and slaves.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most workers were <mark>from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and a few more</mark>, all facing harsh and poor
            conditions in their stay. They worked under tremendous heat, falling from heights due to poor working
            conditions, broken promises about payments, their rooms given were really bad, and more to mention.
            <br>
            <br>

            Imagining the situation of these forced workers, being paid very low made me feel quite uncomfortable. I
            wanted to memorate these workers who have died, and show the world what lies under the world cup that was
            held
            in 2022.
