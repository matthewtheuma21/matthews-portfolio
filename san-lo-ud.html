            <h1>San Lo-Ud Festival - Branding & Advertisment</h1>

            <p>One of the most memorable and rewarding projects I have undertaken was the development of a conceptual
                festival in Rome. This assignment was part of my Erasmus experience at the Accademia Italiana, an art
                school located in the San Lorenzo district. Students from Malta, France (Paris and Lyon), and Italy
                (Milan and Rome) collaborated to design a comprehensive plan for the festival, including its activities,
                branding (logo and slogan), promotional strategies, and budget management. We were divided into groups
                of five to six participants. This experience was highly educational, as it exposed me to diverse
                cultural perspectives and creative approaches. Working collaboratively to develop a cohesive and
                innovative idea was both enriching and productive.
                <br>
                <br>
                The concept behind the arches in the logo was inspired by the aqueducts in San Lorenzo, a prominent and
                historic landmark in that area of Rome. Additionally, the design references the iconic Roman Colosseum,
                which is also characterized by its arches. My intention was to visually simplify these elements into a
                retro modern look that is both aesthetically appealing and immediately recognizable. The design aimed to
                resonate particularly with an Italian audience, for whom the architectural reference would be familiar
                and meaningful.
                <br>
                <br>
                The festival was structured into three thematic phases:
                <br>
                <br>

                <b>San Lo-Ro (San Lorenzo – Rosso; Red)</b>
                <br>
                <b>San Lo-Ad (San Lorenzo – Adesso; Now)</b>
                <br> <br>
                and the grand finale <br>
                <b>San Lo-Ve (San Lorenzo – Verde; Green)</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                Each phase
                symbolized a different temporal dimension—past, present, and future—expressed through artistic and
                musical experiences set in Rome.
                <br>
                <br>
                A particularly proud moment for me was learning that this project also served as a friendly competition
                between all participating groups. Our group achieved second place, while the winning concept—developed
                by my friend and her team—was recognized for having the most well-developed theme and branding. We were
                informed that their concept has a strong possibility of being used for the actual festival and presented
                to the public.

                Although we did not place first, I was genuinely proud of both my personal contribution and our
                collective effort. I was responsible for designing the logo, which became a central element that helped
                guide the overall visual identity of our proposal. It sparked numerous creative ideas within our group
                and played a significant role in shaping the final presentation.
