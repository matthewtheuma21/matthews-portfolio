            <h1>The Ficticious Harmony Festival - Advertisment</h1>

            <p>This was another school assignment, and the given brief was to create visual posters for a music, culture
                and art festival that will be taking place in MFCC, Ta' Qali Park. For this project, I explored several
                design ideas using both vector and raster-based software, depending on what best suited the concept I
                wanted to develop. I created five different digital mock-ups, each reflecting a unique interpretation of
                the festival’s theme. The primary objective was to design a poster that would appeal specifically to
                families attending the event, ensuring the final outcome felt inclusive and representative of the
                festival’s atmosphere.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of my initial concepts focused on individual aspects of the festival—such as a music-centered
                poster featuring a hip-hop dancer, or a cultural approach with a speaker on stage. While each idea had
                merit, I found myself at a crossroads, unsure which direction would best represent the festival as a
                whole. I wanted something more all-encompassing that captured the full spirit of the event. Eventually,
                I arrived at a more general concept that involved masking a crowd photo within the word
                Harmony, stretched across the A4. Visually, it leaned toward a modern-grunge pop style. Although I
                was drawn to the black, white, and red palette (colours I often favour), the overall mood didn’t quite
                reflect the welcoming and family-oriented nature of the festival.
                <br>
                <br>
                This led me to experiment with colour mapping. I shifted the colour scheme to blue tones—and that’s when
                everything clicked. The new palette brought a much friendlier, approachable feel to the design, making
                it feel far more appropriate for the event’s target audience. From there, I made additional refinements
                to the layout and typefaces, aiming to keep the poster clean, simple, and effective while still visually
                engaging.
