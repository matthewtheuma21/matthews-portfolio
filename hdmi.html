                <br>
                I aspired to create a platform that showcases the hidden beauty of Malta, making this knowledge
                accessible both to locals and to tourists visiting our islands. My vision was to develop a website that
                surpasses the quality and usefulness of many existing sites currently available online. Typically, most
                websites in this field fall into one of several categories: some consist solely of visitor reviews,
                often lacking official or reliable information—such as those found on sites like Travelodge—while others
                focus narrowly on a single location. In addition, many existing sites are little more than personal
                travel blogs written by individuals with a passion for exploration.
                <br>
                <br>
                I therefore sought to create a truly valuable and practical resource: an easy-to-navigate website
                featuring a diverse range of locations and picturesque spots across Malta, all gathered in one place. To
                complement this, I also included a carefully curated selection of Malta’s finest and most beautiful
                hotels. While these accommodations may not always be the most affordable, they are highly recommended
                for offering exceptional quality and memorable experiences. The aim was to consider the entire package
                that travellers look for when planning their stay in Malta, combining natural beauty, comfort, and
                cultural richness.
                <br>
                <br>
                In terms of design, I was particularly drawn to the colour palette of blue, yellow, and white. These
                colours evoke a sense of paradise—bringing to mind sandy beaches, clear skies, and the warmth of the
                Mediterranean—while also creating a pleasing visual contrast. The palette is intended to convey a
                distinctly touristic atmosphere, perfectly suited to the spirit of the Maltese islands.
