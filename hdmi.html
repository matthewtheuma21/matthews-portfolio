                I wanted to spread the knowledge of our hidden beauty in Malta to people, Maltese and any tourists
                visiting Malta. However, I simply wanted to make the website better than any other website we find on
                the internet. Usually its either just reviews of the place (and not any official/valid information) like
                Travelodge, and some other websites are just one location per website. Or else its just a travel blog of
                a person who likes to travel. So why not create a useful website to easily find many different locations
                and beautiful spots in one website. I also added some of our best & most beautiful hotels here (maybe
                not the most affordable), but really recommended. I wanted to take in consideration the whole package
                when travelling in Malta.

                I really like the colour combination of blue, yellow and white as a palette. It reminds you of a
                paradise, a sandy beach, imploying a touristic feeling. They make a good contrast.
