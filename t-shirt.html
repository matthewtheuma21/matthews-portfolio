            <h1>T-Shirt Design - "its not professional <br> and it's not ethical"</h1>

            <p>The brief was to develop a t-shirt design for a fashion company called Cringecore, which celebrates a
                bold and playful exploration of the “cringe” aesthetic—embracing humor, irony, and a touch of nostalgia.
                Inspired by this concept, I focused on two popular American TikTok creators known for their
                impersonations of the Kardashians, in which they humorously recreate scenes from The Kardashians TV
                series. Their exaggerated and sassy quotes such as “It’s not professional, and it’s not ethical,”
                “Nnyyeeaaahhh,” and “You're dramatic and pathetic, gurl bye!” perfectly captured the ironic,
                over-the-top energy that aligned with the Cringecore aesthetic. I decided to base my design concept
                around this interpretation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Alongside my main idea, I explored several alternative directions to experiment with different visual
                styles and ways to express the theme effectively on a t-shirt. Through this creative exploration, I
                ultimately decided to adopt a streetwear vibe, which I felt added depth and an appealing edge to
                the overall design.
                <br>
                <br>
                I incorporated photo manipulation techniques, saturated colours, and textured treatments to unify the
                visual elements. My visual research focused heavily on text styling—particularly the use of dynamic
                compositions, angled placements, and serif fonts, which contributed to the bold and ironic tone of the
                final piece. The result, seen on the right, reflects both my creative intentions and the playful nature
                of the brief. I'm genuinely pleased with the outcome and am even considering printing the design on an
                actual t-shirt in the near future.
