    <p>Presented here is one of my most cherished and dedicated works to date. Although it began as a school assignment,
        I approached the project with a high level of commitment and professionalism. I organised and planned
        photoshoots involving several models, carefully selecting specific locations that complemented each theme I
        intended to convey. Every detail—from planning to execution—was carried out with seriousness and purpose. (Note:
        the images of celebrities featured in the magazine are not my own.)
        <br>
        <br>
        The concept behind the project was to design a magazine that offers a fresh and unique take on music
        categorisation. Rather than presenting music in a standard format, I chose to group songs by emotional
        theme—such as happiness, darkness, love, and classic styles. Each category was visually represented by a
        specific colour, selected to match the tone and mood of the genre, creating a distinct visual identity for each
        section. In addition to listing the top 20 songs under each mood, the magazine also featured curated articles
        about artists who reflect the theme of each category.
        <br>
        <br>
        My research involved analysing how established magazines—such as Vogue, Billboard, and Rolling Stone—present
        information in engaging and aesthetically compelling ways. I observed that these publications often integrate
        brand advertisements throughout their pages to promote collections and merchandise, and I considered this aspect
        in my own layout decisions.
        <br>
        <br>
        The primary goal of my magazine was to redefine how music can be promoted and explored. Instead of focusing
        solely on individual artists or displaying generic top 10 global charts, I wanted to create a more personal and
        accessible experience. By organising music by emotional themes and offering a rich, visually-driven narrative,
        the magazine invites readers to discover new music that aligns with their mood or taste—whether it's a song
        they’ve never heard before or one they’ve long enjoyed but never knew the title of.
